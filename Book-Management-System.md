<h1>Book Management System (BMS) Project Plan</h1>
<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<h3>1.1. Project Title</h3>
<h3>Book Management System (BMS)</h3>
<h3>1.2. Project Description</h3>
<p>The Book Management System (BMS) is a full-stack web application aimed at helping users manage personal book collections. The system will allow users to add, edit, and delete books, categorize books by genre, and calculate the age of each book based on its publication date. The project will progress from basic HTML and JavaScript functionality to incorporating advanced features like asynchronous operations, responsive design, and TypeScript conversion, following the agile development process.</p>
