<h1>Book Management System (BMS) Project Plan</h1>
<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<h3>1.1. Project Title</h3>
Book Management System (BMS)
1.2. Project Description
The Book Management System (BMS) is a full-stack web application aimed at helping users manage personal book collections. The system will allow users to add, edit, and delete books, categorize books by genre, and calculate the age of each book based on its publication date. The project will progress from basic HTML and JavaScript functionality to incorporating advanced features like asynchronous operations, responsive design, and TypeScript conversion, following the agile development process.
1.3. Project Objectives
•	Functional Objectives:
o	Build an interactive web-based system for managing books.
o	Implement features for book addition, editing, deletion, and categorization by genre.
o	Calculate the age of each book using JavaScript.
o	Persist data using browser localStorage.
o	Integrate responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS or Material CSS.
•	Non-Functional Objectives:
o	Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
o	Maintain clean, scalable code with emphasis on SOLID principles.
o	Implement GitHub workflow with branches and pull requests for collaboration.
2. Project Scope

•	User Interface:
o	Develop a clean, user-friendly interface for book management.
o	Implement form validation and error handling for incorrect inputs.
2.2. Out-of-Scope
•	Backend Services: No backend server or database is included.
•	Advanced Features: Search, sorting, exporting/importing data, and authentication will not be part of the initial scope.
3. Project Deliverables
3.1. Functional Deliverables
•	Book Management System (BMS):
o	Fully functional web application for managing books.
o	Implementation of book operations (add, edit, delete).
o	Book categorization by genre and age calculation.

•	Source Code:
o	Code repository on GitHub.
o	Implemented GitHub workflows (branches, pull requests).
•	Documentation:
o	User guide and technical documentation.
o	Testing report with detailed coverage of test scenarios.
3.2. Documentation Deliverables
•	Project Plan: Initial project plan outlining objectives, timeline, and resources.
•	Testing Report: List of test cases and results ensuring feature completeness.
